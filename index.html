    <h3>AJATT immersion!!!</h3>
    <p>
      I'm going to start doing AJATT-style immersion in Japanese because I'm tired of sucking at Japanese! This sucking needs to stop!
      I had a few false starts in the past, but after reading AJATT, I know I'll be motivated to follow through this time for a few reasons:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        I know I can do this.
      </li>
      <li>
        I know if I do this it will work and I'll be fluent.
      </li>
      <li>
        I know that it will be worth it.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Won't immersion be really hard??</h3>
    <p>All I have to do is show up, so no. The hardest part will probably be just getting in the habit of showing up.</p>

    <p>
      <b>Easy parts:</b>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Since I'm already familiar with Chinese, the kanji will be the easiest part to learn.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      <b>Not as easy parts (initially):</b>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Getting in the habit to playing Japanese all the time.
      </li>
      <li>
        Getting in the habit of making new Anki cards every day.
      </li>
      <li>
        The first 1000 Japanese-Japanese Anki cards.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      I'm going to go at this pretty hard because I want to be fluent as quickly as possible. I imagine that after getting in the habit of doing this every day, it will get a lot easier. The first month will definitely be the most difficult.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Will this even work??? Don't you need Genki/textbooks/grammar books/X???
    </h3>
    <p>
      Only time will tell. I think it's just a matter of clocking in my 10,000 listening hours and putting in my 10,000 J-J Anki cards.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>The beginning plan (first month):</b>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Learn 100 Glossika Japanese sentences a day (to get a good base of 3000 sentences with audio)
      </li>
      <li>
        Learn 100 Kanji from Remembering the Kanji a day (to be able to read all the Kanji I'll ever come across)
      </li>
      <li>
        Listen to Japanese as much as possible (to get used to Japanese's sounds)
      </li>
      <li>
        Read as much Japanese as possible (get used to reading and adding sentences)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      I'll be tracking my progress and continuing to share my thoughts.
